This is the beginnings of a GUI program that plays bridge.

How to run it:

* Install version 300 or later of drscheme (http://www.drscheme.org).

* Run `drscheme bridge.ss'.  Choose the "module" language.  Click the
  "Run" button. You should see some messages in the bottom (from
  tests) reporting successes, 0 errors, and 0 failures.  Then the
  program will draw a table on the screen, and you're off.

There's a similar-looking program at http://abridgegame.org/.

If you build it standalone with `mzc --gui-exe bridge bridge.ss', you
may find that it fails with

    collection-path: collection not found: #<path:games/cards> in any of: ()

     === context ===
    cloop
    #f::353: loop

I know of no simple fix, but the problem is described, and a rather
complex fix is suggested, at
