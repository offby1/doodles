Make a read-only lisppaste replica.

It'd be a servlet for the PLT web server.  It would occasionally use
XML-RPC to download data from the real lisppaste, and would render it
in some amusing way.  Perhaps it would have an "add new paste" button
that points back to the real lisppaste.

First we'd need to download at least one page's worth of headers, and
build a page around that.  (We could defer downloading any other
headers until our user actually asked for them (but that brings up the
problem: how do we show nice progress messages in the web browser
while we download the rest?))
