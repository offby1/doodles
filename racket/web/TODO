* Password server?

I wouldn't embed my Amazon secret key in a file -- it would be too
easy to accidentally disclose -- e.g., if someone asked to see all my
nifty web-service code, and I happily send 'em all my files,
forgetting to omit the one with the password in it.

Right now I'm passing the secret on the command line, but that doesn't
thrill me either, since I fear my shell history will wind up with
copies of it.

I suppose I could put it in Emacs' environment, and invoke the
programs from Emacs ...

But another idea is to build a tiny server whose sole purpose in life
is to store the key, and yield it on demand.  It would be like an
ssh-agent.  The benefit there is that you only need utter the secret
on the command line once, when you start it; thenceforth it could
serve lots of requests.

Dunno if it's worth the trouble.
