Grab some cat pictures from flickr, find geotags on them, then draw a
Google map with one of those little pointer thingies for each picture.
"Cats in your neighborhood".

For extra credit, give each pointer thingy the behavior that, when you
hover your mouse over it, it displays a thumbnail of the picture.

Ugh.  The Google Maps API forces me to code in JavaScript.  Ain't
gonna happen.
