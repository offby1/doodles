Moore, contractor, (ed. note: Mr. Moore was a JGSO board member) is nearing completion.  This is a striking and interesting building with massive, carved beams of cedar and a delightful Oriental atmosphere.  The hand-made roof tile has been ordered from Nara, Japan for the Entrance Building, Tea House and parapet wall surrounding the Stone and Sand Garden.  Professor Tono has advised that the tile should arrive in January (1967.)  This is a very significant portion of the Japanese building design.  The individualtiles are large, over 12"" square, hand-made, and each structure requires over twelve different tile shapes to provide authentic roof treatment.""",,X
