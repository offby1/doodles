I sometimes put comments for a given function not in the function
itself, but rather in the tests for that function.  So if you're
wondering how function `foo' works, be sure to read the comments in
the function `foo-tests', if such a function exists.

To try it out:

* clisp

start clisp, and at the prompt type `(load "bridge.system")', then `(mk:operate-on-system :bridge :compile)'.
