This is the beginnings of a GUI program that plays bridge.

How to run it:

* Install drscheme (http://www.drscheme.org).

* install `schemeunit' from
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/schematics.  You may need to be root
  to do this, depending on where drscheme is installed.

* similarly install `srfi'.

* Run `drscheme bridge.ss'.  Click the "Execute" button. You should
  see some messages in the bottom (from tests) reporting successes, 0
  errors, and 0 failures.  Then the program will draw a table on the
  screen, and you're off.

There's a similar-looking program at http://abridgegame.org/.
