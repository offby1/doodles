Camera suggestions for a beginner

("35mm" "medium format" "large format" "APS") 
35mm, absolutely.  Medium and large format are more expensive and less
convenient.  Their only advantages are in better image quality, but
35mm is capable of producing perfectly fine images; only pros and
maniacal amateurs use medium or large format.

APS is new, expensive, and probably poor image quality.  Avoid it.

("SLR" "TLR" "viewfinder" "groundglass")

SLR.  Considered by themselves, SLR is only mildly better than TLR or
viewfinder; groundglass is so inconvenient that nobody in their right
mind would use it if they didn't have to.  But as far as I know, there
are no 35mm TLR or groundglass cameras; the bulk of 35mm viewfinders
are point-and-shoots, which don't have interchangeable lenses.

("interchangeable lenses" "fixed lens")
Absolutely interchangeable lenses.

("electronic shutter" "mechanical shutter" "no shutter")
Electronic shutter is preferable to mechanical, since it's more likely
to be accurate.  But mechanical is OK as long as it works well.
 
("built-in motordrive" "optional add-on motordrive" "manual film advance")
Whatever you like.  Manual film advance cameras may be cheaper,
though.

("autofocus" "manual focus")
Whatever you like.  Manual focus is likely to be cheaper, though.

("forced autoexposure" "optional autoexposure" "no autoexposure")
Forced autoexposure is absolutely out of the question; you'll never
learn to expose properly if you use it.  Optional autoexposure is
fine, but don't become dependent on it.

("built-in flash" "hot shoe or sync terminal" "no flash capability")
Hot shoe or sync is definitely the best -- built-in flashes tend to be
underpowered, and are usually fixed to point directly at the subject
(which makes for ugly pictures).
