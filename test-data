    you are.

@A: Huxley, Thomas Henry (1825--1895)
@Q: Science is nothing but trained and organized common sense, differing from the latter only as a veteran may differ from a raw recruit: and its methods differ from those of common sense only as far as the guardsman's cut and thrust differ from the manner in which a savage wields his club.

@Q: We possess the Canon because we are mortal and also rather belated.
    There is only so much time, and time must have a stop, while there is
    more to read than there ever was before.  From the Yahwist and Homer to
    Freud, Kafka, and Beckett is a journey of nearly three millennia.  Since
    that voyage goes past harbors as infinite as Dante, Chaucer, Montaigne,
    Shakespeare, and Tolstoy, all of whom amply compensate a lifetime's
    rereadings, we are in the pragmatic dilemma of excluding something else
    each time we read or reread extensively.

@Q:     Do not fear to put thy feet
        Naked in the river sweet;
        Think not leech, or newt, or toad
        Will bite thy foot when thou hast trod;
        Nor let the water, rising high,
        As thou wadest, make thee cry,
        And sob; but ever live with me,
        And not a wave shall trouble thee.

@A: Huxley, Aldous (1894--1963)
@Q: Every notable advance in technique or organization has to be paid for,
    and in most cases the debit is more or less equivalent to the credit.
    Except of course when it's more than equivalent, as it has been with
    universal education, for example, or wireless, or these damned
    aeroplanes.  In which case, of course, your progress is a step backwards
    and downwards.

@C: This assessment of progress is delivered by the wealthy hedonist Eustace
    Barnack but it seems to express Huxley's view also. [[[Eustace Barnack.]]]
