* set the monitor's "sleep" delay on the command line

* Show estimated time of completion.

* ambitious: GUI it

  It'd be fun to watch the progress graphically.  Imagine that the
  conses in the template are represented by what looks like an
  odometer -- little wheels.  Each would have a label under it to tell
  what letter it corresponds with.  So if the template were currently

        ("Yo: " (#\a . 10) ", " (#\s . 4) " and " (#\t . 8) ".")

  the thing would look like

                ____  ____  ____
                |10|  | 4|  | 8|
                ----  ----  ----
                  a     s     t

  and they'd whirl by.

* Count backwards

  Let's say I've set *min* to 1 and *max* to 14.  Since finished
  sentences might well have closer to 14 of a particular letter than
  1, we'd find the truth faster by counting backwards.

* Give each letter its own min and max

  ... instead of having them be global.  Thus e's max might be 20
  whereas q's would be 1.

* For the case when we're following loops through the multidimensional
  space, arrange a break handler so that when I hit Control-C, before
  quitting, it gives me statistics about how full the count->boolean
  map is.

* Trap the runtime error ``vector-ref: index blah out of range'', and
  automatically bump *max* and restart.
