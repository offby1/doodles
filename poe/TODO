The next step is to stop using Component::Client::TCP, and instead use
the next higher-level POE thingy (POE::Session, perhaps) so that I can
have _multiple_ callbacks for server input, instead of the single one
that Component::Client::TCP gives me -- that way I won't have to write
my own dispatcher to figure out what kind of message the server is
sending me.
