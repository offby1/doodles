* !! In predict-score, use a _fresh_ history ...

... rather than dragging along the current history.  That will
certainly be faster, and ought to return the same result.

* factor out "distinct" code ...

Both tricks and hands are essentially sets: they require that they
never have two of the same card.  Perhaps create a new type that is a
set, and build tricks and hands on top of that.

* find dead code ...

... by using
http://planet.plt-scheme.org/300/docs/clements/no-brainer.plt/1/0/doc.txt
(thanks for the tip, Eli!)

* cause all my structures to print nicely

... so that I don't have to call "hand->string" all the time.  See
http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/352/html/mzscheme/mzscheme-Z-H-11.html#node_sec_11.2.10
(thanks, Kilimanjaro!)

* see if the U of Alberta has any hints

... since they have a games site at http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/,
which mentions hearts and spades
