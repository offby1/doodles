* factor out "distinct" code ...

Both tricks and hands are essentially sets: they require that they
never have two of the same card.  Perhaps create a new type that is a
set, and build tricks and hands on top of that.

* find dead code ...

... by using
http://planet.plt-scheme.org/300/docs/clements/no-brainer.plt/1/0/doc.txt
(thanks for the tip, Eli!)

* cause all my structures to print nicely

... so that I don't have to call "hand->string" all the time.  See
http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/352/html/mzscheme/mzscheme-Z-H-11.html#node_sec_11.2.10
(thanks, Kilimanjaro!)

* see if the U of Alberta has any hints

... since they have a games site at http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/,
which mentions hearts and spades

* keep track of the returns from predict-score ...

... and at the end of the hand, see how well it did.  I'd expect the
predictions from the beginning of the hand to be wild, but as the hand
progresses, they'd close in on accurate ... sort of the way Firefox's
file-download progress bar predicts how long it'll take to finish.
