Convert the Excel spreadsheet into something parseable -- XML is an
obvious choice ... then parse it into simple structures ... then shove
some of the structure data into flickr.

I think I used Office 2007 to save the thing as "XML Spreadsheet 2003".

The obvious problem is that many rows lack data for certain columns --
but it's not at all clear -which- column is missing.  In some rows
it's the subject; in others it's the mount notation.
