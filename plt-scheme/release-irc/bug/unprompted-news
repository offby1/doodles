in 4629: Nobody asked him for news, and the channel hadn't been quiet
for 20 minutes, and yet:

<offby1> vm looks like abandonware                                                         [08:34]
<squido> What about mews?
<fledermaus> there are also mew and wanderlust (wl)                                        [08:35]
<fledermaus> offby1: yes, SA went crazy and dumped 4GiB of logs into the fs.
<Sketch> i was just looking at vm, someone else took over vm recently
<fledermaus> it got caught and cleaned up.

<offby1> oh dear.  The bot spewed news when the channel hadn't been quiet for 20 minutes   [08:40]

I just noticed that, at 7:49, I'd said "rudybot: news", and he'd
responded with no news.  I wonder if by saying that I'd signaled the
direct-bot-command-evt, which then stayed signaled until the next
headline came in.  If that's the case, then I need to somehow "expire"
that event if it doesn't get used quickly :-|

===

It occurs to me that the easy fix is to simply eliminate the
direct-bot-command-evt, and go back to detecting commands like "news"
and "quote" in the main loop, and responding to them synchronously.

Ideally I'd write a test that shows the presence of this bug, fix the
bug, then ensure that the test passes ...
