Doesn't "related work" sound grandly academic?

Anyway, here are some other Scheme bots I know of:

* https://svn.bountysource.com/scm-irc/trunk

* http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/eggs/irc.html
  (not a bot, really; just a library)

* http://monkeyboy.td.org.uit.no/~cin/feckbot

CIA isn't scheme, but it's a pretty serious bot, and probably has been
designed carefully: http://svn.navi.cx/misc/trunk/cia/
