Features from the old bot worth keeping:

* "seen"                        done
* "eval"
* "quote"                       done
* "uptime"                      done
* "VERSION" and "SOURCE"        done
* /msg nickserv ghost, if needed (not sure it's needed)

Features I am NOT keeping:

* spewing a funny quote when it doesn't otherwise recognize what was said to it
* spewing news headlines, etc., every so often when the channel has been silent
