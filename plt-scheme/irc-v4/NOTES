Here's what I think the _real_ model is:

* Whenever we read from the server, we should set a timeout of ... I
  dunno ... a couple minutes; the server is supposed to send PING
  messages that often, and so if the timeout expires, we consider the
  connection dead, and need to reconnect.

* Whenever we attempt to connect, we should be prepared to deal with
  exn:fail:network?, and try again.
