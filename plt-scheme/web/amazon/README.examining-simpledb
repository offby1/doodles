In theory, the web page at
AmazonSimpleDB-2009-04-15-scratchpad/webapp/index.html lets you play
with the API; in practice, it's pretty flaky, and often doesn't work.
Using it in Firefox 4 with a "bare" profile seems to work, but what's
the point ...

More convenient is the "aws" program in the current directory.  Its UI
is a bit weird, but it works.  Try

        ./aws select 'select * from frotz'
