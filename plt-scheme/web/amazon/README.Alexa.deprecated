Dear Alexa Developer,

The Alexa Web Search service will no longer be available to new customers as of November 26, 2008.  Use of the service is low, so we are shifting our priorities to other areas where we can provide better service to AWS customers.

The Alexa Web Search service will continue to be operational for 60 days until January 26, 2009.  The ProgrammableWeb website offers a list of web services that provide web search: http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?apicat=Search

We apologize for the inconvenience to you.  

Thank you,

The Alexa Web Services Team
