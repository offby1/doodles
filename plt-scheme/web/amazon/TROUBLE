Once in a while, apparantly at random, things fail:

* It complains the signature doesn't match

* Some other problem that escapes me

Trying again makes it work.

Try it like this:

        $ while ./amazon-s3.ss ; do sleep 1; done

You'll see it fail soon.

I wonder if the problem happens when the signature is shorter than
usual -- it doesn't seem to complain with these sigs
