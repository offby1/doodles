Here's how you, Ed, can test this.

First, open your spreadsheet and save some or all of the worksheets as
.CSV files.

I'll have sent you a .zip file; unzip it, somehow.

Click the "flickr-thingy" icon.  You _should_ see a simple window
appear at the top of your screen.

Click the "File" menu; choose "Open"; find the .CSV files that you
saved, and select one or more of them.  Then of course click the
"Open" button.  You should see the word "Searching ..." appear on the
bottom of the window, then "Examining page 1 of 20 ...", with the "1"
slowly counting up.  Then finally you should see a mysterious popup
that says "Joined", with a bunch of gibberish like

    ((#(struct:datum 7212 May-92 X)) (#(struct:datum 7211 May-92 X))
    (#(struct:datum 7893 Jun-94 X)) (#(struct:datum 7892 Jun-94 X))

If you got that far, then everything has worked!
