On the progress bar, instead of just showing numbers like

                23/102

include _units_.  Like: is that 102 photos, or is it 102 _pages_ of
100 photos??!!


Also, look at
http://www.flickr.com/photos/10665268@N04/sets/72157602034640576/detail/?page=2
; note that J3030's caption has no italics; but if you click on the
picture, and go to its own page, the caption indeed has italics.  This
seems either like a bug on flickr's part, or at least poor
documentation.

* Is "Cancel" Safe?

If we're uploading, and we hit the Cancel button, can we guarantee
that the upload will either complete, or cancel cleanly?  I.e., is one
http upload command atomic?
