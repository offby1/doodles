* General idea

Convert the Excel spreadsheet into something parseable -- XML seems an
obvious choice, but as far as I can tell, it's ambiguous; CSV is much
simpler and isn't ambiguous ...

... then parse it into simple structures ... then shove some of the
structure data into flickr.

* tying the spreadsheet to the images

Looks like the images are named with a capital J, then some digits;
and the digits correspond to the number in the spreadsheet.
