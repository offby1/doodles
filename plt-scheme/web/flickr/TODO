* Decent error handling

For example, if you run "profile.ss", and the user named by *username*
isn't found, you get a big ugly stack trace.

* Learn more about sxpath

so that, e.g., I can collapse the three sequential sxpath calls in
profile.ss@3993 to just one

* Handle failures better

If the web server disconnects or returns an error, the whole client
program stops.  It'd be nice if there were a way to retry.

* Persistent memoization?

Let's say I run the thing, and it cranks away for ten minutes, finding
lots of contacts of lots of people.  Then it falls over.  The next
time I run it, it'll have to do all that work over again -- even
though the (now lost) data that it got last time is probably still
accurate.  I'd like the second run to be able to reuse that data, so
it can pick up where the first run left off.

I have written complex tedious code to load and restore the data
myself.  But I wonder if something like that already exists ...
