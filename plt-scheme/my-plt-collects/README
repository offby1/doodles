To make the code in here available to mzscheme programs in general:

(You only need to do this once per machine)

Create and install a .plt archive of this directory, by typing

        make check

Then to use e.g. the 'howdy' module, put this in your code:

        (require (planet "howdy.ss" ("offby1" "my-plt-collects.plt")))

If for some reason you'd like to purge your PLaneT cache -- e.g., in
order to test all of the above -- do

        rm -rf ~/.plt-scheme/planet
