Yes, I am fourteen years old, and have written a sloppy, crude,
incomplete IRC bot.

To run the bot, try "./run-bot.ss --help".  

To do very crude code-coverage analysis, type "./tools/coverage.ss".

Some tests:

./run-all-tests.ss

I developed it using bleeding-edge versions of PLT scheme in July 2007
(370.6).  I know that it doesn't work with Version 352; I don't know
about versions in between those.

I tested it against the dancer-ircd package that I found in Ubuntu
Ubuntu 7.04 "feisty": 1.0.36-7, and against irc.freenode.org, which is
probably also dancer-ircd.
