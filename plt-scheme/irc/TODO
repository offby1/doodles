-- High priority

* make it more resilient to bad input
  e.g., if the server sends a line with too few fields, I'll tokenize
  it and then merrily call e.g. (list-ref tokens 4) on it, thus
  crashing.  Alas, I can't repro this.

* Deal with netsplits, or whatever the hell it is 
  ... that makes the bot not work even though /whois says it's still
  there.  Also, what do I do if it connects and the server says that
  the nick is already registered?  (Answer: try again, specifying some
  other nick via the --nick command-line flag.)

** Maybe registering the nick on freenode will help.

-- Low priority

* Convert from strings to bytes
  Wherever possible, change from using "string" procedures to "bytes"
  procedures -- since IRC doesn't specify any character encoding.  As
  things stand now, we're implicitly using UTF-8 everywhere; it'd be
  better for the encoding to be explicit.  That way, eventually I
  could have per-channel encodings.

* maybe periodically see what channels _I'm_ in ...
  and join them if it's not already in them.  Like a little puppy dog.
  This is harder than it sounds, since it's not blindingly clear who
  "I" am -- sometimes my nick changes.  It would probably be best to
  find me by host name, not nick.

* allow it to be accessed by a REPL while it's running
  I don't really know what I mean by this, but: I often think of
  improvements to make to it, and hate having to stop it and restart
  it in order to incorporate those improvements.

* Catch Control-C so that we don't spew an ugly stack trace when we're killed.
  Maybe even do a nice PART and QUIT while we're at it.

* Do the tinyurl thing!!
  I.e., whenever anyone utters a URL (that isn't itself a tinyurl),
  send it to tinyurl, and utter the tiny version.  A public service!
  This is harder than it seems at first; I had some sort of trouble
  with URL quoting.

* Do buubot's job...
  ... find Ebert reviews of movies.  Use IMDB; find the "external
  reviews" link; find Ebert's name.  (I honestly think this would be
  as reliable as searching on rogerebert.com; that site's design is as
  lame as its content is excellent)

* jordanb quotes

** Play with pipe size
  I think it's 4096 now, or something.  See if bigger or smaller
  values make it faster.

** Cancelling the thread takes a while
  I.e., I say "shaddap", and it emits a few more quotes before going
  away (at least, if the interval is just a few seconds).  It should
  be immediate.

** Catch up the testing!
  As often happens, development has pulled ahead of testing.  In
  particular, the jordanb-quote-thread stuff isn't tested.

* emacschannelquotes
  <e1f> offby1: you need to include emacschannelquotes in rudebot
  He means snag stuff from
  http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?EmacsChannelQuotes, but I'd
  rather not do that since most of those quotes are multi-line, and
  wouldn't look good if collapsed.

* new commands

** Respond to "version"
  since people seem to expect that

** "uptime"
  since I'm occasionally curious

* don't restrict "seen" to the current channel

  I.e., if bob speaks in #cats, and someone in #dogs asks "seen bob",
  we should say "bob last spoke, in #cats, at 1:23:45 PM, saying
  "meow"

* 
<fledermaus> every time jordanb chips in with a "Let's..." statement,
rudebot should reciprocate.

* a "channel" abstraction
  It's uh ... a stream of messages.  Yeah.  Maybe a lazy stream.  Or
  something.  Every time we JOIN we create a new one and save it in a
  list.  The as-yet-unwritten "do-when-channel-idle" would take it as
  an argument.

* planet snarfing at startup
  Currently when we start up, we snarf all the headlines but don't
  emit any of them, since they're all older than (current-date).  That
  guarntees that we won't spew old news when we start (which is
  annoying when I'm constantly restarting the bot).  But ideally we'd
  spew _one_ old headline -- the latest -- at startup, just to prove
  we can.
