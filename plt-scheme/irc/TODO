-- Low priority

* finer control of logging
  Right now I have a single boolean -- *verbose* -- which controls
  logging.  But it might be nice to have that be a list instead; each
  module would log if and only if it finds on that list a symbol
  assoicated with that module.  That way I could start with the list
  empty, but if I suspected that (say) the moviestowatchfor thread was
  acting funny, I could do, at the repl, something like (add-to-list!
  (*things-to-log*) 'moviestowatchfor)

  If modules were first-class, we could put _them_ on the list
  directly, instead of each module having to create its own symbol
  just for that purpose.

** open log file before threads start
   I often see messages going to stderr even though I've specified
   that they should go to the log file; I assume these messages are
   coming from threads that are running before *log-output-port* gets
   set to the log file.

* read memos?
2007-08-10T15:35:01-0700:  <= #4(struct:message "MemoServ!MemoServ@services." "NOTICE" ("rudybot" "You have a new memo from \u0002offby1\u0002 (#2)"))
2007-08-10T15:35:01-0700:  <= #4(struct:message "MemoServ!MemoServ@services." "NOTICE" ("rudybot" "Type \u0002/msg MemoServ READ 2\u0002 to read it"))

* ack "MODE" at startup
  after we do "/msg nickserv identify" (so that we can send private
  messages on freenode), the server responds with <<:services. MODE
  rudebot :+e>> .  We should note receipt of that message, in case it
  _doesn't_ come and we're wondering why we can't sent private
  messages.

** don't log in everywhere?
   I imagine that other IRC networks, besides freenode, either don't
   require logging in, or have a different way of doing it.  We should
   really log in only if we clearly need it

* low-priority bugs

** "CTCP source" doesn't return an FTP site :-)

http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/ctcpspec.html says that the source
should be hosted on an FTP server, which I don't care to run, so ...

* quotes and news headlines

  I should make the silly quotes have a different period than the news
  headlines, so they don't always arrive together.  This is mostly
  irrelevant, though, since if there's any real chatter in the
  channel, each will get delayed by more-or-less random amounts.

** <j85wilson> 

   offby1: suggestion for rudybot: only have him spew news in a
   channel if there has been speech since the last time he spewed news

* Windows

** Test regularly
   I'd have expected that the repl won't work there, since I try to
   use "readline", and yet it seems ok

* write our own identd server
  like every other IRC client out there.

* Deal with netsplits, or whatever the hell it is
  ... that makes the bot not work even though /whois says it's still
  there.  Also, what do I do if it connects and the server says that
  the nick is already registered?  (Answer: try again, specifying some
  other nick via the --nick command-line flag.)

** Now that I've registered some nicks on freenode ...
   (namely "rudybot" and "rudebot"; they're "linked"), maybe that'll
   help.  Perhaps it should do something like "/msg nickserv identify
   <password>" when it starts up.  It should thus take a new
   command-line flag for specifying the password.

** Maybe simply detecting them
   ... and then exiting, is better than doing nothing

** timeout?
   The server PINGs us peridodically; perhaps, if we don't hear
   anything at all after, say, 200 seconds, we assume we've been
   disonnceted, and try to reconnect.

* reset terminal state on abort
  I notice that, when I abort the terminal in which the bot (and, in
  particular, its repl) is running, I need to type "reset" at the
  shell in order to see characters echo.  This is a bug in mzscheme
  itself
  (http://bugs.plt-scheme.org/query/gnatsweb.pl?cmd=view%20audit-trail&database=default&pr=8836),
  but I should at least work around it.  (elibarzilay says it can't be
  done but I don't believe him)

* persistence
  It'd be nice to save stuff to disk.  Currently I save the date of
  the last planet.emacsen.org headline that we spewed in the the PLT
  "preferences" file ...  But I dunno if simply "write"ing an
  sexpression will suffice for more complex data ... it'd be nice to
  have bindings to Berkeley DB.

  On the other hand, I can't think of much that I need to persist
  ... maybe the appearances-by-nick data for the "seen" command.  That
  seems a perfect application for sqlite, which I seem to have an urge
  to play with ...

  http://www.elemental-programming.org/Bigloo%20SQLI.html and
  http://planet.plt-scheme.org/package-source/jaymccarthy/sqlite.plt/3/1/doc.txt
  both seem like they might do it; the former seems slightly more
  up-to-date.
  http://planet.plt-scheme.org/package-source/dfisher/sql-table.plt/1/1/doc.txt
  looks particularly pleasant.

* Find some way to deal with exceptions in threads
  e.g., "procedure internal-entries-newer-than: expects 3 arguments,
  given 2 ...".  That procedure application is happening in a thread
  other than the main one, and so rather than the whole app dying, it
  just hangs.  This is annoying when I'm running tests -- the tests
  will sometimes pass despite the thread puking.  Naturally I want the
  process to exit with a non-zero status, to ensure that I notice the
  thread dying.

* Convert from strings to bytes
  Wherever possible, change from using "string" procedures to "bytes"
  procedures -- since IRC doesn't specify any character encoding.  As
  things stand now, we're implicitly using UTF-8 everywhere; it'd be
  better for the encoding to be explicit.  That way, eventually I
  could have per-channel encodings.

* maybe periodically see what channels _I'm_ in ...
  (where "I" means "someone with the nick 'offby1'") and have the bot
  join them if it's not already in them.  Like a little puppy dog.
  This is harder than it sounds, since it's not blindingly clear who
  "I" am -- sometimes my nick changes.  It would probably be best to
  find me by host name, not nick.

** brx suggests a "stalk" function
   which takes the name of a victim.  Like the above but oh so
   sinister.

* Catch Control-C so that we don't spew an ugly stack trace when we're killed.
  Maybe even do a nice PART and QUIT while we're at it.

* movies
** Spew less often
   I should probably have the movies, headlines, jordanb quotes all
   have different intervals.  Maybe they should even depend on what
   channel they're spewing to ...
   <Riastradh> Perhaps exponential delays?
   <Riastradh> Twenty minutes makes sense for the first one, but not every twenty minutes.

** Do buubot's job...
  ... find Ebert reviews of movies.  Use IMDB; find the "external
  reviews" link; find Ebert's name.  (I honestly think this would be
  as reliable as searching on rogerebert.com; that site's design is as
  lame as its content is excellent)

** restrict to more recent reviews
   rather than always displaying the 15 most recent, limit to, say,
   those from the last week

* emacschannelquotes
  <e1f> offby1: you need to include emacschannelquotes in rudebot
  He means snag stuff from
  http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?EmacsChannelQuotes, but I'd
  rather not do that since most of those quotes are multi-line, and
  wouldn't look good if collapsed.

* new commands

** "eval"
   sandbox.ss is a safe way of doing "eval" -- i.e., they can't call
   "exit", can't mess with the filesystem, etc.

** "you suck"
   to emit some TODO list entries, or just a URL to the TODO file

** "help"

** "uptime"
   since I'm occasionally curious

** auto shakespeare insults
   I've got scheme code to do that around here somewhere.

** echo URL titles
   the way feck does

* repl commands

I wonder if I should make a new module that contains stuff
specifically for interacting with the bot via the REPL.  It'd be
essentially a full-blown IRC client with a scheme syntax.

** join and part
   so that I can change which channels it's on without restarting it

** privmsg
   since I clearly enjoy putting words in its mouth.  Such a command
   would save a few keystrokes; as it now stands I have to type
   something like

        (put "PRIVMSG ##cinema :\u0001ACTION casually moves in front of offby1\u0001")

   Be nice to abbreviate that to (PRIVMSG/ACTION "casually moves in
   front of offby1")

   Note that the REPL uses readline, and has completion, so the
   rather long identifier PRIVMSG/ACTION wouldn't actually be hard to
   type.

   Note also that this idea suggests that the bot, or at least the
   repl, have the notion of a "current channel", just like any other
   IRC client; and thus there ought to be a command that changes the
   channel.  Also obviously there should be a way to find out what
   channel you're in; I suspect the REPL prompt can easily be made to
   include that.

** examine a timer
   Maybe have the timers constantly visible in the repl (it'd be nice
   to have curses support to do this).  So I could watch them count
   down.

* truncate output from "seen" command
  because it can be annoyingly long, if the last thing they said was
  annoyingly long.

* 
  <fledermaus> every time jordanb chips in with a "Let's..."
  statement, rudebot should reciprocate.

  Or at least it should squirrel away the quip.

* Terminology
  I suspect there is one RFC-1149-ly correct term for what I variously
  call "requester" and "source" (i.e., the guy who sends an IRC
  message), and other terms.  Try to use the same terms that the RFC
  uses, so that someone who's familiar with the RFC, when reading this
  code, will feel right at home.
