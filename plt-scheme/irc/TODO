* maybe periodically see what channels _I'm_ in, and join them if it's
  not already in them.  Like a little puppy dog.  This is harder than
  it sounds, since it's not blindingly clear who "I" am -- sometimes
  my nick changes.  It would probably be best to find me by host name,
  not nick.

* allow it to be accessed by a REPL while it's running
  I don't really know what I mean by this, but: I often think of
  improvements to make to it, and hate having to stop it and restart
  it in order to incorporate those improvements.

* Figure out how to spew silliness at random intervals.
  Possibly a separate "silly-spew" thread: it sleeps, then does a
  single PRIVMSG.  Maybe for extra fun, have it grab text to spew from
  some web service.

* Catch Control-C so that we don't spew an ugly stack trace when we're killed.
  Maybe even do a nice PART and QUIT while we're at it.

* Do the tinyurl thing!!
  I.e., whenever anyone utters a URL (that isn't itself a tinyurl),
  send it to tinyurl, and utter the tiny version.  A public service!

* Do buubot's job...
  ... find Ebert reviews of movies.  Use IMDB; find the "external
  reviews" link; find Ebert's name.

* Maybe trim leading and trailing whitespace from tokens

* Keep track of who spoke when
  I think fsbot does this, in order to answer questions like "seen
  so-and-so".  Simply: every time someone says something, note the
  nick, the time, and the channel.

* Deal with netsplits, or whatever the hell it is 
  ... that makes the bot not work even though /whois says it's still
  there.  Also, what do I do if it connects and the server says that
  the nick is already registered?  (Try again, passing a --nick
  command.)

** Maybe registering the nick on freenode will help.

* jordanb quotes

** multi-line quotes get truncated
   I.e., I suspect they occupy more than one line in the log file in
   ~/log, but my simpleminded "grep" function only retrieves the first
   line.

** Cancelling the thread takes a while
  I.e., I say "shaddap", and it emits a few more quotes before going
  away (at least, if the interval is just a few seconds).  It should
  be immediate.

** Catch up the testing!
  As often happens, development has pulled ahead of testing.  In
  particular, the jordanb-quote-thread stuff isn't tested.

* Convert from strings to bytes
  Wherever possible, change from using "string" procedures to "bytes"
  procedures -- since IRC doesn't specify any character encoding.  As
  things stand now, we're implicitly using UTF-8 everywhere; it'd be
  better for the encoding to be explicit.  That way, eventually I
  could have per-channel encodings.

* emacschannelquotes
  <e1f> offby1: you need to include emacschannelquotes in rudebot
  I'm not entirely sure what that means, but what the hell.
