* maybe periodically see what channels _I'm_ in, and join them if it's
  not already in them.  Like a little puppy dog.  This is harder than
  it sounds, since it's not blindingly clear who "I" am -- sometimes
  my nick changes.  It would probably be best to find me by host name,
  not nick.

* allow it to be accessed by a REPL while it's running
  I don't really know what I mean by this, but: I often think of
  improvements to make to it, and hate having to stop it and restart
  it in order to incorporate those improvements.

* Figure out how to spew silliness at random intervals.
  Possibly a separate "silly-spew" thread: it sleeps, then does a
  single PRIVMSG.  Maybe for extra fun, have it grab text to spew from
  some web service.

* Catch Control-C so that we don't spew an ugly stack trace when we're killed.
  Maybe even do a nice PART and QUIT while we're at it.

* Do the tinyurl thing!!
  I.e., whenever anyone utters a URL (that isn't itself a tinyurl),
  send it to tinyurl, and utter the tiny version.  A public service!

* planet:
  <bpalmer> If more than 1 minute have passed with no activity other
          than parts/joins, and if there is a not-yet-announced
          headline on planet.emacsen.org, {display it}

* Do buubot's job...
  ... find Ebert reviews of movies.  Use IMDB; find the "external
  reviews" link; find Ebert's name.

* Maybe trim leading and trailing whitespace from tokens

* Get exit status right for tests.
  simple-tests.ss doesn't call exit at all, which means that if "make"
  invokes it, "make" won't notice if any tests failed.  But
  coverage.ss requires simple-tests.ss, and wants to do stuff after
  requiring it; so simple-tests had better not call "exit" because
  that'd prevent coverage from doing its cool after stuff.

  The solution is probably to have the file that runs the tests be
  separate from that which defines them.
