* maybe periodically see what channels _I'm_ in, and join them if it's
  not already in them.  Like a little puppy dog.  This is harder than
  it sounds, since it's not blindingly clear who "I" am -- sometimes
  my nick changes.  It would probably be best to find me by host name,
  not nick.

* allow it to be accessed by a REPL while it's running
  I don't really know what I mean by this, but: I often think of
  improvements to make to it, and hate having to stop it and restart
  it in order to incorporate those improvements.

* Cure the infinite loop introduced in r4135
  Maybe there's some general-purpose thing I could do: if the bot
  speaks more than five times in a second, "throttle" it back so that
  it waits a second before every utterance or something.  Or maybe
  just have it not respond _to a particular nick_ too often.  Hmm hmm
  hmm.

* Figure out how to spew silliness at random intervals.
  Possibly a separate "silly-spew" thread: it sleeps, then does a
  single PRIVMSG.  Maybe for extra fun, have it grab text to spew from
  some web service.

* Catch Control-C so that we don't spew an ugly stack trace when we're killed.
  Maybe even do a nice PART and QUIT while we're at it.

* Do the tinyurl thing!!
  I.e., whenever anyone utters a URL (that isn't itself a tinyurl),
  send it to tinyurl, and utter the tiny version.  A public service!

* Private messages seem to have a colon as the first character.
