Lynn says my step-niece Nelly has been cast in a movie along with
Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, and Nicole Kidman.  Let's see if I can
figure out which movie it is.

First I collect the titles of those actress' movies that haven't yet
been released; they go into files named after each actress.

Then I read each file into a set, similarly named.

Then I use the itertools.permutations thingy to come up with each possible pair of sets.

Then for each of those pairs, I see what titles are in common.
