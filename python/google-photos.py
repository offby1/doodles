So ... I'd like to learn how to upload photos to Google Photos.
Sounds like it should be simple, right?  Noooo.

There doesn't appear to be a Google Photos API.  There is, however, a
picasaweb API: https://developers.google.com/picasa-web/.  That page
says "Beginning May 1st, 2016, weâ€™ll start rolling out changes to the
Picasa Web Albums Data API and no longer support the following
functionality" Last I checked, it was December 2016.  Everything about
this site seems abandoned.

There's a python API for "version 1" (the docs suggest there's a
stable version 2, and a "draft" version 3, but no python clients for
either).  The python client's tutorial tells me to use a version of
OAuth that seems obsolete and unsupported.

My remaining hope is that I can upload photos to some sort of generic
data-uploading API such as https://cloud.google.com/storage/, which as
best I can tell from the marketing gibberish, is roughly equivalent to
Amazon's S3.  There appears to be a python client at
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-python.

The Google Services docs are so various and complex that it's
daunting.  I keep putting off reading them.
