For no good reason, I'm wondering if I could merge all these
mostly-the-same-but-slightly-different versions into one.

Here are the ways in which the various implementations most seem to
differ: 

* hash tables

You'd think there'd be some hash-table SRFI that I could use in all of
these versions.

http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-69/srfi-69.html is fairly recent.  It
appears to be supported only by PLT scheme v300.

SRFI 44 is a bit older; it appears to include hash tables (and a lot
more besides); not a single implementation supports it :-(

* module systems

This will probably never be standardized; it seems too contentious.

* regular expressions

SRFI?  Prolly not.

On a Debian system with mzscheme installed, the SRFIs live at
/usr/lib/plt/collects/doc/srfi/index.htm ... although on _this_ box,
it's at /usr/local/stow/plt/collects/srfi
