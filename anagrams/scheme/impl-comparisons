For no good reason, I'm wondering if I could merge all these
mostly-the-same-but-slightly-different versions into one.

Here are the ways in which the various implementations most seem to
differ: 

* hash tables

You'd think there'd be some hash-table SRFI that I could use in all of
these versions (there's a SRFI 69, but it appears to be supported only
by PLT scheme v300 and Chicken).

* module systems

This will probably never be standardized; it seems too contentious.

* regular expressions

SRFI?  Prolly not.

On a Debian system with mzscheme installed, the SRFIs live at
/usr/lib/plt/collects/doc/srfi/index.htm ... although on _this_ box,
it's at /usr/local/stow/plt/collects/srfi

* bignums

Some have 'em; some don't.

* SRFI 7

This SRFI might make it easier to write portable code.  Here are
implementations that claim to support it:

** scheme48
** mzscheme
** chicken
** scsh
