;; Notes about bags in general:

;; creating a bag from a string needn't be all that fast, since we'll
;; probably only do it a few thousand times per application (namely,
;; reading a dictionary of words), whereas subtracting bags needs to
;; be *really* fast, since I suspect we do this O(n!) times where n is
;; the length of the string being anagrammed.
