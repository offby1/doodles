A grab bag of ideas that are applicable to all the implementations,
but probably appear only in some.

* Use a simple string of sorted letters as the bag.

This isn't necessarily better than any other method for all
implementations, but it seems the best for Perl, since it can be used
as a hash key (convenient when reading the dictionary).  And anyway,
subtracting two such things ought to be fast, assuming that substr is
fast.

And yet I tried this first when writing the C++ version.  It worked
OK, but I then tried using bignums ... and they were twice as fast.
Hmm.

* Use `configure' to figure out where the dictionary lives.

I've only tried the programs on a few computers, and yet each has the
dictionary in a different place.  Windows is of course particularly
bad.  If using `configure' is too complicated, perhaps just an
environment variable.

* Allow a command-line option to specify the location of the dictionary

* Languages to do

** perl6

** Haskell

** tcl !
