zenhacks 1.0.1 has a bug: it needs to #include <time.h> somewhere or
other on GNU libc systems.  The symptom is that "make check" here will
fail with an error from the C compiler, complaining that
CLOCKS_PER_SEC isn't defined.

This works on my Ubuntu "dapper" laptop, but didn't work on my Debian
sarge box; I don't know why.  But I don't care, since that box is now
running Ubuntu just like the laptop ...
