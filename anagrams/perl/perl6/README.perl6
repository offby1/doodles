Perl6 seems to be changing all the time.  Here are some places that I
suspect are the equivalent of the Camel book:

http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/synopsis.html
and
/usr/local/src/langs/pugs/docs/Perl6/Spec/
and
/usr/local/src/langs/perl6-doc/
and
http://perlcabal.org/syn/?      -- has more synopses than the above
