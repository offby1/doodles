Stuff I might want to do:

* See if C# has something like this nifty feature in Delphi: you can
  write a function that enables a control based on the states of other
  controls, and have the system call your function "in the
  background", when nothing is happening.  Thus you can keep all the
  code for enabling that control in one place, rather than scattered
  throughout the program.

  The documentation has a broken link for something called
  "Event-based Asynchronous Pattern" that might be this.

* Somehow sort something so that bigger words come first.

* Make Control-A do its thing no matter where the focus is in the form
  -- currently it works only if the input box has the focus.

* Write it in a multi-threaded way so that it's easy to interrupt.
  The way it is now, if I wanted to write code that allows me to
  interrupt it, I could have an "interrupt" button that clears a
  global flag named something like "ok_to_run", but then each loop
  would have to check that variable's value, which is ugly.  In a
  perfect world, the loops would run in a separate thread, and the
  button would simply kill that thread.

* Investigate the "Begin whatever" and "End whatever" whatchamacallits
  for adding listview items; it might speed that operation up.

* Add the usual "Help" menu item with an "About" entry.
