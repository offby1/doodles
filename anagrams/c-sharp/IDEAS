Stuff I might want to do:

* See if C# has something like this nifty feature in Delphi: you can
  write a function that enables a control based on the states of other
  controls, and have the system call your function "in the
  background", when nothing is happening.  Thus you can keep all the
  code for enabling that control in one place, rather than scattered
  throughout the program.
