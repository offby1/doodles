Stuff I might want to do:

* See if C# has something like this nifty feature in Delphi: you can
  write a function that enables a control based on the states of other
  controls, and have the system call your function "in the
  background", when nothing is happening.  Thus you can keep all the
  code for enabling that control in one place, rather than scattered
  throughout the program.

* Move the stuff that is in Form1.cs, but doesn't really pertain to
  Windows GUI stuff, into anagrams.cs

* Make the controls resize as the top-level window resizes.  As it
  stands now, if you maximize the window, they don't get bigger, which
  looks silly.
