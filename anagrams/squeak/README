Since I'm barely competent with Squeak, here's instructions for getting this working:

* Start a new Squeak

* left-click the desktop background to bring up the "World" menu

* choose "open ..."

* choose "file list"

* browse to this directory, and choose any of the ".cs" files

* middle-click (on *nix; I think it's right-click on Windows) the file and choose "fileIn entire file"

* repeat the last step for the other .cs files

Now you've loaded the code.  To test it:

* world menu/open/SUNit test runner

* click the "deselect all" button

* scroll through the list of classes until you find BagTest

* click it

* click "Run One"

You should of course see the fabled green bar.

If I ever get the code to the point where you can actually generate
anagrams, I'll be sure to explain how to use it here.
